# What is the differense in using RESET / REVERT / CHECKOUT in redoing things?

- RESET - moves what HEAD points to and resets working directory, changes commit history
- REVERT - reverts changes of selected commit in a new commit
- CHECKOUT - moves HEAD between objects without changing commit history
